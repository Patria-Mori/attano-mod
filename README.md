# PM - The Attano Module

This module servers two main purposes.

The first is as a convenient module for providing automation in Foundry VTT for the homebrewed rules, items, etc. that affect the Locke Attano player character in the PM campaign.

The second is as a proof of concept and prototype for using more advanced JavaScript tools. Unlike the other modules, this is built with a more complex stack that requires more set-up, but which leverages tools like Vite, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions to improve the development workflow and provide useful automation.
