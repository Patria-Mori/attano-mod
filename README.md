# PM - The Attano Module

This module servers two main purposes.

The first is as a convenient module for providing automation in Foundry VTT for the homebrewed rules, items, etc. that affect the Locke Attano player character in the PM campaign.

The second is as a proof of concept and prototype for using more advanced JavaScript tools. Unlike the other modules, this is built with a more complex stack that requires more set-up, but which leverages tools like Vite, TypeScript, and GitHub Actions to improve the development workflow and provide useful automation.

## Installation

To install the module, paste one of the following links into the "Manifest URL" input in the Install module window in Foundry.

**Latest**

https://github.com/Patria-Mori/attano-mod/releases/latest/download.json

This will install the latest release of the module (you should be able to automatically update within Foundry after installing it once).

In this case this is also the "proper" module, and not the template.

**v0**

https://github.com/Patria-Mori/attano-mod/releases/download/v0/module.json

This will install the v0 template.
